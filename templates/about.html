            We are a 100% black-owned, 50% youth-led emerging funeral society that offers more than just monetary and affordable, quality burial support. 
            We aim to provide compassion, emotional and spiritual presence, and a sense of community that combines culture and religion.

        <p class="about-text">
            Like the Shembe religion, which combines faith and spirituality — with emphasis on culture, we strive to make our members feel at home by offering support rooted in the very essence of what it feels to be African.
